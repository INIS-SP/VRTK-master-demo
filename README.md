# VRTK Master - Additional Demo

## Demos Scenes

1. Better Controls

In this demo, `Q` and `E` has been mapped as the grab trigger for left and right hand respectively. This should allow you to perform other complex interactions such as climbing and shooting of shotgun.

2. Demo with Environment

In this demo, you are stuck in the wilderness and needs to perform certain tasks to survive. The tasks are designed to show how you can make use of `Boolean Actions` and `All Actions` to help create a sequence of tasks with minimal scripting.
